## Changelog

### Version 1.34
Mar 10, 2020

- Internal: Clean up deprecated code and unused imports ([PR-109](https://github.com/jenkinsci/durable-task-plugin/pull/109))
- Internal: Remove utility function for tempDir and use implementation from core instead ([PR-110](https://github.com/jenkinsci/durable-task-plugin/pull/110))
- Internal: Upgrade parent pom to 3.54 ([PR-119](https://github.com/jenkinsci/durable-task-plugin/pull/119))
- Fix: Explicitly close `ProcessPipeInputStream` to prevent agent-side OOM ([JENKINS-60960](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-60960))
- Internal: Make `generate-binaries` script return error. Refactor unit tests to support infra changes and to skip binary tests
  when binary is not generated ([PR-121](https://github.com/jenkinsci/durable-task-plugin/pull/121))

### Version 1.33
Oct 29, 2019

- Disable binary wrapper caching when there are inadequate permissions to access the cache dir (namely containerized instances).
  ([JENKINS-59903](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-59903))
- Do not use binary wrapper on non-x86 and FreeBSD architectures ([JENKINS-59907](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-59907))

### Version 1.32
Oct 28, 2019

> **WARNING**: The bugs introduced in 1.31 are still present (([JENKINS-59903](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-59903),
> [JENKINS-59907](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-59907))

- Migrate changelog from wiki to github, add README ([PR \#113](https://github.com/jenkinsci/durable-task-plugin/pull/113))
- Disable binary wrapper (introduced in 1.31) by default.
    - To enable binary wrapper, pass the system property
      `org.jenkinsci.plugins.durabletask.BourneShellScript.FORCE_BINARY_WRAPPER=true` to the Java command line used to start Jenkins.

### Version 1.31
Oct 22, 2019

> **WARNING**: This version (1.31) introduced bugs where scripts will not be able to launch on non-x86 platforms and
> container-based agents that do not have access to the agent node's root directory.
 
> **NOTE**: To revert to previous release behavior, pass the system property
> `org.jenkinsci.plugins.durabletask.BourneShellScript.FORCE_SHELL_WRAPPER=true` to the Java command line used to start Jenkins.

-   Update ssh-slaves ([PR \#100](https://github.com/jenkinsci/durable-task-plugin/pull/100))
-   Do not fail tests when run on a machine without Docker installed.
    ([PR \#101](https://github.com/jenkinsci/durable-task-plugin/pull/101))
-   Improve watcher logging
    ([PR \#102](https://github.com/jenkinsci/durable-task-plugin/pull/102))
-   Refactor UNIX unit tests for greater test coverage
    ([PR \#103](https://github.com/jenkinsci/durable-task-plugin/pull/103))
-   Allow setting pwsh as Powershell executable
    ([PR \#112](https://github.com/jenkinsci/durable-task-plugin/pull/111))
-   Bugfix: Use setsid instead of nohup ([JENKINS-25503](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-25503))
    - For *NIX systems only, the shell wrapper has been replaced with a pre-compiled golang binary.
    - The binary launches the script under a new session to better survive unexpected Jenkins terminations.
    - Just like how the shell wrapper executes in the background (since 1.30), the script launcher
      is a daemonized process. The means that there is an expectation of orphaned-child cleanup
      (i.e. zombie-reaping) within the underlying environment.
    - The binary itself is ~2.5MB per binary. There are 4 pre-compiled binaries (32 and 64bit versions
      for UNIX and DARWIN).
    - The memory footprint is ~800KB heavier than the shell wrapper.
        - The two shell processes (610-640KB) and single sleep process (548KB) are replaced by a
          single process (~2560KB)

### Version 1.30
Jul 05, 2019

-   Bugfix: Run the wrapper process for shell scripts in the background.
    ([JENKINS-58290](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-58290)). This
    means that when the script exits, the wrapper process will be orphaned. In most cases, the
    orphaned process is cleaned up by the underlying OS (ie zombie-reaping). Special flags must
    be used to enable zombie-reaping in docker containers (--init) or kubernetes pods (shared
    process namespaces).
-   Bugfix: Use `sh` to run shell scripts rather than attempting to
    use the absolute path to the default shell from the master on
    agents. ([PR \#95](https://github.com/jenkinsci/durable-task-plugin/pull/95))
-   Bugfix: Make PowerShell exit codes propagate correctly. Fixes a
    regression from version 1.23
    ([JENKINS-52884](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-52884))

### Version 1.29
Jan 31, 2019

    step. ([JENKINS-37341](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-37341))

### Version 1.28
Nov 14, 2018

-   Bugfix: Do not rely on a shebang line to select the interpreter
    for `sh` scripts. This means that Pipelines can now use relative
    names for interpreters accessible from the `PATH` environment
    variable.
    ([JENKINS-50902](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-50902))

### Version 1.27
Nov 01, 2018

-   Do not print the working directory or the type of script being run
    when a durable task starts. ([PR \#83](https://github.com/jenkinsci/durable-task-plugin/pull/83))
-   Internal: Shut down thread pools when Jenkins shuts down. Should
    only affect other plugins using this plugin in their tests.

### Version 1.26
Sep 25, 2018

-   Bugfix: Increase the default heartbeat interval used to detect dead
    processes from 15 seconds to 5 minutes
    ([JENKINS-48300](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-48300))

    agents directly instead of having the Jenkins master pull logs from
    build agents
    ([JENKINS-52165](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-52165))

### Version 1.25
Aug 8, 2018

-   Major bugfix: Fix regressions in 1.23 and 1.24 that caused build
    failures when running `sh` steps in minimal environments such as
    Alpine and Cygwin

    Alpine-based build agents
    ([JENKINS-52847](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-52847))
-   Developer: Define API for gathering command output in a local
    encoding
    ([JEP-206](https://github.com/jenkinsci/jep/blob/master/jep/206/README.adoc))

### Version 1.23
Jul 31, 2018

    endlessly-repeating logs
    ([JENKINS-37575](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-37575))

    wrapper script running the durable task dies

-   Fix/Enhancement: Simplify Powershell execution and make it more
    consistent

### Version 1.21
Mar 8, 2018

-   Bugfix: Resolves regression with Batch steps "hanging" on some
    Windows build agents
    ([JENKINS-50025](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-50025))
    introduced by 1.19
    -   Fix for existing builds suffering the issue: go into the control
        directory in the workspace and run 'move jenkins-result.txt.tmp
        jenkins-result.txt' - the batch step will complete normally

### Version 1.20
Mar 7, 2018

        ([JENKINS-48057](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-48057))
    -   Step always returns success
        ([JENKINS-47797](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-47797))
-   Add passing of TaskListener API
    ([JENKINS-48300](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-48300))
-   Test fixes

### Version 1.17
Nov 21, 2017

-   Version 1.16 accidentally declared a Java dependency of 8+, despite
    being otherwise compatible with Jenkins 2.7.x+ which run on Java 7.
    Reverted to 7+.
-   Internal: improved resilience of Docker-based test suites.

Plugin](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Pipeline+Nodes+and+Processes+Plugin)
to 2.9 or later
([JENKINS-41339](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-41339)).
